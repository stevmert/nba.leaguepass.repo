## Introduction

[International NBA League Pass](http://www.nba.com/leaguepass/) is an online service offering streaming video of NBA games.

This [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) plugin features:

* Archive and condensed games for the current NBA season. [Games from previous seasons are no longer included (apparently you can purchase each for $8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9wsoes/the_nba_has_quietly_removed_access_to_previous/)
* Home and Away feeds for archive games
* Highlights and Top Plays
* NBA TV live (League Pass Premium is required)
* Live game support
* Fanart from feeds, and thumbnails

The first version of this plugin was written by [robla](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=124716). Petros Tsampoukas then modified it to work with the 2012 and 2013 NBA seasons, and added images. It requires a valid International League Pass account.


## Installation

### Requirements

As of 24 March 2014, all games require XBMC/Kodi v13 (Gotham) or higher versions. The archive and condensed games used to work in Frodo but the streams switched to using encryption with HLS, which does not work with Frodo due to faulty cookie support.

### From the kodi repositories

Go into Addons > Install from repository > Video Addons > NBA League Pass > Install

### Using a zip file

First download the latest version from the [download page](https://bitbucket.org/maxgalbu/plugin.video.nba/downloads#available-downloads). Then install the addon from a zip file in xbmc ([instructions](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file)).
